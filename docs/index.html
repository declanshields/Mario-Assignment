							<p>This project was created during semester 2 of Fundamentals of Games and Graphical Systems and was created using OpenGL. This is a somewhat realistic model of the solar system using a rough scale. <b>
							The aim of this module was to learn how to load 3D objects and texture them as well as applying lighting in a 3D environment. <b>
							For this project, I used data from the NASA website to display on the screen for the user to see, as well as implementing proper controls for the user to navigate the world, including the ability to snap
						to either the next or the previous planet. <b>
						While I was unable to correctly load a sphere .obj file by reading it in manually, I am still proud of this project as I believe it to be a good representation of the solar system, even if the planets all have penguins on them.
					If I were to go back to this project and update it, I would include proper texturing for the planets as well as implementing sphere .obj's to better improve the realism of the project.</p>
